# Contribution Guidelines

## Contributing to KkiaPay

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

Please note: We take KkiaPay's security and our users trust very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in KkiaPay, please responsibly disclose by contacting us at support@kkiapay.me.

First: As a potential contributor, your changes and ideas are welcome at any hour of the day or night, weekdays, weekends, and holidays. Please don't ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request.

If you are unsure, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving it your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

That said, if you want to ensure that a pull request is likely to be merged, talk to us! You can find out our thoughts and ensure that your contribution won't clash or be obviated by KkiaPay's normal direction. A great way to do this is via KkiaPay Discussions or the KkiaPay Chat.
